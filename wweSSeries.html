  <p>After much back and forth, Ripley’s team gained the upper hand. SKY hit a Swanton Bomb off the top rope, taking out Legend, Jax, Sane, and Asuka with a trash can. Ripley then hit a Rip Tide on Becky Lynch, followed by Lee locking in the Black Widow submission. Becky fought but finally tapped out. <strong>Winners:</strong> AJ Lee, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, IYO SKY, and Rhea Ripley</p>

  <p><strong>Intercontinental Championship:</strong> John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio</p>
  
        <p>Midway through the match, Cena accidentally knocked out the ref. Cena locked in the STF on Dominik. Finn Balor and McDonagh attacked Cena but were fought off with a Double AA. Dominik tried to hit Cena with the title but Cena dodged and hit an AA. A new ref was called but instead Liv Morgan returned, slapped Dominik, hugged Cena, then shocked everyone by dropping Cena with a low blow. Dominik capitalized with a 619 and Liv hit Cena with the title. Dominik finished with a Frog Splash for the win.</p>
   
  
  <p><strong>Women's World Championship:</strong> Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella</p>
  <p>Back and forth action that spilled to the floor. Vaquer took control with a clothesline and delivered the Devil's Kiss on the announce table. Back in the ring, she hit another Devil's Kiss followed by a moonsault off the ropes to pin Nikki and retain the title.</p>

  <p>High intensity match with Superman Punches, Spears, Suplexes, F5s, GTS, Superkicks, and Brass Knuckle hits. Punk seemed set to win after putting out Logan with GTS, but a hooded figure climbed the cage and superkicked Punk, then hit a Curb Stomp before leaving. Breakker capitalized with a big spear and pinned Punk for the win.</p><p><strong>Winners:</strong> Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bronson Reed, Bron Breakker, and Brock Lesnar</p>
  <p>Roman Reigns looked unhappy but showed sportsmanship by helping Punk up. Cody Rhodes stood on his own as the three men stared each other down to close the show.</p>
